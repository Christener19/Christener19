### 👋 Hello World! I'm Christener, Your Future Web Developer!

---

🌐 **About Me:**  
Delving into the world of web development, I bring the same enthusiasm I have for solving complex puzzles. My recent journey through the School of Code's four-month bootcamp has equipped me to be a versatile junior full-stack web developer. Whether it's tackling front-end aesthetics or back-end functionality, I embrace each challenge with a zest for learning and growth. Beyond coding, I find joy and relaxation in spending time with animals, a perfect contrast to the digital world. With a combination of technical skills and a love for both logic and life's simple pleasures, I am ready to contribute to and grow in the dynamic tech industry.

🚀 **Current Project:**  
Diving headfirst into a 4-week adventure with my team, Shift Happens! We've partnered with a stakeholder to bring to life "Intern" – a dashboard designed to effortlessly track boot campers' attendance. It's where functionality meets creativity!

💡 **What Drives Me:**  
My journey in tech is fueled by a dual passion: enhancing my own life and positively impacting others. I'm invested in being a part of cutting-edge technologies and projects. For me, the joy of making things, facing new challenges, and diving into the unknown is not just about personal growth—it's about creating solutions that better the world around us. Every project is a chance to leave a mark, to contribute to something larger than myself, and to be part of the ever-evolving digital landscape.
